# Go Have An Adventure

Not much to this yet. I'm very new to the language and just laying down some basic groundwork for eventually actually turning this into the game.

### Todo

- ~~Figure out avoiding linebreaks mid-word in dialogue boxes~~ ✅
- ~~Add support for multiple paragraphs appearing in a single dialogue box~~ ✅
- Everything else :)

### How To

#### Dialogue Box format codes

Note: These codes _must_ be wrapped with empty spaces to work correctly.

| Code  | Description    |
| ----- | -------------- |
| \<p\> | New paragraph  |
| \<l\> | New line       |
| \<d\> | Create divider |
